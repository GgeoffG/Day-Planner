# Day-Planner

## Description


- This webpage serves as a way to plan tasks for an average work day in hour time blocks
- The webpage shows the current day, and represents the current hour block, previous hour blocks, and future hour blocks in a color-coded display.
- The application of this webpage is simple and easy to use, saving tasks with the click of a button.
- This application saves data to the users Local Storage so that the user can return to the webpage on their computer at a later time and still see their tasks.
- Undertaking this project has allowed me (Geoffrey) to learn more about, and gain a better understanding of, Jquery tags, Local Storage, DOM traversal,
  applying CSS classes through Javascript, and much more.
